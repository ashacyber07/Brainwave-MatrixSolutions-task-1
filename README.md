Build a Python Cyber Security - Phishing Link Scanner

# Description
This project is about building a phishing link scanner in Python. The tool allows users to scan URLs for phishing indicators, contributing to online security.

# 📂 Project Structure

  # 🔧 Tools & Technologies Use
   - 🐍 Python 3.x  
   - 📦 Libraries: `re`, `whois`  
   - 📝 Text Editor: VS Code / Notepad  
   - 💻 OS: Windows/Linux  
   - 🖥️ CLI: Terminal / Command Prompt  

 ## 🎯 Objective
  - Detect phishing URLs based on patterns and keywords
  - Flag IP-based links and shortened URLs
  - Check domain registration info via `whois`
  - Output simple reports indicating suspicious or safe URLs

📈 Future Scope
   * Integrate machine learning-based phishing detection
   * Check against real-time phishing databases (Google Safe Browsing)
   * Build a GUI using tkinter or convert to a web app
   * Browser extension for real-time link scanning

# Features
  * Retrieve web page content.
  * Analyze HTML content for suspicious forms.
  * Detect common phishing indicators.

# conclusion
  This Python tool helps detect suspicious links using simple rules like phishing keywords, IP usage, and shortened URLs. It is a basic but effective project to raise awareness about phishing and lays the          foundation for building smarter cybersecurity tools in the future.
